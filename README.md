## My process

<!-- I first began with the HTML skeleton for the project and then proceeded to implement the CSS styles for the final look and outcome. -->

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla CSS
- CSS custom properties
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

<!-- Using HTML, CSS Grid and Flexbox where applicable to create an efficient dashboard design. Responsive layout wil be ignored for the current project at this stage.
- EDIT: In the end I did add some responsiveness. This was really an enjoyable project in the end! Looking forward to more. -->

### Continued development

<!-- To eventually make the design:
- Responsive
- Perhaps tablet ready (Due to screen real estate)
- Javascript functionality -->
